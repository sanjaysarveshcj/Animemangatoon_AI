User Interaction: Implemented a loop to allow users to ask questions continuously until they decide to exit.
Response Generation: The chatbot generates answers by matching user input against the defined keywords.

Code Documentation:
Code is documented with comments explaining the function and purpose of each part.
The chatbot's responses are clearly defined and easily extendable for future improvements.

Usage:
